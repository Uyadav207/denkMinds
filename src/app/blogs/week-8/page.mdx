# Week 8: 🔐 Implementing ZAP Active Scans in MIRA  

Following our previous blog on **ZAP passive scanning**, this post delves into **ZAP active scanning**. We will discuss what active scanning is, its importance, and how we implement it in **MIRA** to ensure robust cybersecurity assessments.

## What is ZAP Active Scanning?  

ZAP active scanning involves actively **probing and interacting** with the target application to identify security vulnerabilities.  

### Key Features:  
- 🔎 **Comprehensive Probing**: Sends requests and payloads to test for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.  
- 🧪 **Simulates Real-World Attacks**: Identifies weaknesses by actively engaging with the application.

## Why is Active Scanning Important?  

### Benefits of Active Scanning:  
1. 🛠️ **Comprehensive Testing**:  
   - Detects vulnerabilities that might be missed by passive scanning.  
2. 🔐 **Proactive Security**:  
   - Actively tests the application’s defenses, ensuring real-world readiness.  
3. 📋 **Detailed Insights**:  
   - Provides thorough reports on potential security risks and recommendations.

## Why We Chose ZAP for Active Scanning  

ZAP’s **active scanning capabilities** are trusted and widely supported by the security community. Its ease of integration with MIRA and detailed reporting features make it an ideal choice.  

### Key Advantages:  
- 🤝 **Seamless Integration**: Works flawlessly with MIRA’s existing architecture.  
- 🌟 **Community Support**: Backed by a strong and active user base.  
- 📊 **Rich Reporting**: Offers actionable insights to address vulnerabilities.

## Step-by-Step Process for Active Scanning  

### 1. **Input URL in Chatbot** 📝  
- The user provides the target URL, compliance standard, and scan type (active).  

### 2. **API Request Handling** 🔗  
- The chatbot sends an **API request** to the backend with the entered information.  

### 3. **Controller Handling** ⚙️  
- The **zapController.ts** file processes the request and calls the `baselineScanService` function with the target URL and scan type.  

### 4. **Executing Active Scan** 🐳  
- The **baselineScanService.ts** file:  
  - Sets up the Docker command for ZAP active scanning.  
  - Executes the scan in a Docker container, actively probing the application for vulnerabilities.  

### 5. **Processing Results** 📄  
- The **JSON report** generated by the scan is processed.  
- CWE IDs are mapped to CVE IDs, and compliance data is enriched for better insights.  

### 6. **Returning Results** 💾  
- The processed results are sent back to the controller, which forwards them to the chatbot.  

### 7. **Chatbot Response** 💬  
- The chatbot displays the **scan results** to the user in an easy-to-understand format.

## ✨ What’s Next: Report Generation  

🚀 Our next step is **enhancing report generation** for ZAP scan results. This includes:  

1. **📄 Vulnerability Reports**:  
   - Comprehensive reports that detail identified vulnerabilities, their severity, and remediation steps.  

2. **💬 Chat Summaries**:  
   - User-friendly overviews of the security assessments, summarized from chatbot interactions.  

Stay tuned as we continue to refine MIRA and elevate its cybersecurity assessment capabilities!
