## Week 2:  Building Momentum at DenkMinds

This week at DenkMinds, weâ€™ve taken significant steps toward shaping our companyâ€™s future and refining our processes as we work toward delivering innovative AI-powered solutions.  

---

### Choosing the Right Technologies  
Weâ€™re in the process of selecting the best technologies for our projects. For the frontend, weâ€™re considering **React.js, a reliable and widely-used library for building dynamic user interfaces. On the backend, weâ€™re evaluating **Hono as an alternative to Express.js due to its speed and performance advantages. However, weâ€™re also factoring in the learning curve for all team members to ensure a smooth workflow before finalizing our tech stack.

### Seamless Collaboration  
To streamline communication and discussions, weâ€™ve adopted Slack as our primary collaboration tool. This will help us organize component discussions and maintain clear communication channels, ensuring everyone stays aligned.

### Presenting to Investors  
After defining our mission, vision, and purpose last week, we prepared and delivered a detailed presentation about DenkMinds to potential investors. Our focus was on introducing our flagship AI product, the Smart Security Assessment Toolâ€”a user-friendly chatbot designed to cater to both beginners and advanced professionals.  

We were thrilled to rank in the top 3 for our presentation skills, which showcased not just our innovative ideas but also our ability to communicate them effectively.

### Meeting with Investors  
We also conducted a planning meeting with investors to refine the productâ€™s roadmap. Key discussions included:  
- Core Features and Functionality: Ensuring our tool is robust and intuitive.  
- Security Standards: Meeting industry requirements for top-notch security.  
- User Experience: Prioritizing simplicity without compromising on advanced features.  

Their feedback has given us valuable insights into aligning our product with market needs.

### Whatâ€™s Next?  
As we move forward, weâ€™re excited to share the basic implementation of our product in the upcoming week. Stay tuned for more updates on how weâ€™re bringing our vision to life!
