# Week 7: 🛡️ Implementing ZAP Passive Scans in MIRA

In our continuous efforts to enhance MIRA, our AI-assisted cybersecurity assessment tool, we have integrated **ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)** for passive scanning. This blog post will cover what ZAP passive scanning is, why it is important, and how we implement it in MIRA.

## What is ZAP Passive Scanning?  
ZAP passive scanning involves monitoring and analyzing **HTTP traffic** between the client and the server without actively interacting with the target application.  

### Key Features:  
- 🛑 **Non-Intrusive**: Does not modify or generate additional traffic.  
- 🔍 **Silent Monitoring**: Identifies issues without disrupting normal operations.  
- 🔒 **Secure Assessment**: Ensures thorough traffic analysis without interfering with the application.

## Why is Passive Scanning Important?  

### Benefits of Passive Scanning:  
1. 🛡️ **Non-Intrusive**:  
   - Does not disrupt the normal operations of the target application.  
2. 🚦 **Early Detection**:  
   - Identifies potential security issues early in the development cycle.  
3. ✅ **Compliance**:  
   - Ensures adherence to security policies without impacting application performance.

## Why We Chose ZAP for Passive Scanning  

ZAP is a popular open-source security tool known for its robustness in both active and passive scanning. Its features align perfectly with our goal of enhancing **MIRA's security assessment capabilities**.  

### Key Advantages:  
- 🤝 **Ease of Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with MIRA.  
- 📊 **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed reports for informed decision-making.  
- 🌟 **Open Source**: A cost-effective and flexible solution.

## Step-by-Step Process for Passive Scanning  

We’ve designed an efficient workflow to integrate ZAP passive scanning into MIRA:  

### 1. **Input URL in Chatbot** 📝  
- The user inputs the target URL, compliance standard, and scan type (passive) into the chatbot.  

### 2. **API Request Handling** 🔗  
- The chatbot sends an API request to the backend with the provided information.  

### 3. **Controller Handling** ⚙️  
- The **zapController.ts** file processes the request.  
- It calls the `baselineScanService` function with the target URL and scan type.  

### 4. **Executing Passive Scan** 🐳  
- The **baselineScanService.ts** file:  
  - Sets up the Docker command for ZAP passive scanning.  
  - Executes the scan in a Docker container to monitor HTTP traffic passively.  

### 5. **Processing Results** 📄  
- The generated **JSON report** is read and processed.  
- CWE IDs are mapped to CVE IDs, and compliance information is enriched.  

### 6. **Returning Results** 💾  
- The processed results are sent back to the controller, which then forwards them to the chatbot.  

### 7. **Chatbot Response** 💬  
- The chatbot displays the scan results to the user in a clear and detailed manner.
