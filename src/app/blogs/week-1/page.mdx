## 🚀 Setting the Foundation  

The first step in building DenkMinds was to create a strong foundation, starting with our **company name** and **logo**. After much brainstorming, *DenkMinds* emerged as a name that perfectly captures our vision:  
- **Denk**: Derived from the German word for "think," representing forward-thinking solutions.  
- **Minds**: Symbolizing creativity, collaboration, and innovation.  

The **logo** reflects these values, combining modern aesthetics with a focus on innovation and teamwork. It sets the tone for everything we aim to achieve.

## 🛠️ Tools for Success  

To ensure efficient collaboration and project management, we’ve adopted **Jira** as our primary tool. Its intuitive boards allow us to track tasks across three categories:  

- **To Do**: Tasks we’ve planned.  
- **In Progress**: Tasks actively being worked on.  
- **Done**: Completed tasks.  

This transparent system ensures that we stay aligned as a team while working toward our goals.

## 👥 Team Roles and Responsibilities

- Capitalize on each other’s strengths.

Clear responsibilities ensure that every member contributes meaningfully to our shared vision.
