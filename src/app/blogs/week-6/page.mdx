# Week 6: AI & LLM Integration for Smarter Threat Detection 🔐

We are excited to share our latest progress on MIRA, our AI-assisted cybersecurity assessment tool. Our focus has been on enhancing MIRA with a Large Language Model (LLM) integration. Here’s a detailed update on our recent work.

## Backend Setup ⚙️

To set up our backend API, we utilized **Hono**, a lightweight and edge-ready web framework. Known for its efficiency and simplicity, Hono is the perfect fit for our needs. We paired it with **Bun**, a high-performance JavaScript runtime, known for its unparalleled speed. This combination has provided us with a responsive and high-performance environment for our application.

### Key Benefits:
- **Hono**: Offers a straightforward and efficient way to create web applications and APIs.
- **Bun**: Ensures faster execution times and improved performance for JavaScript applications.

## Connecting to OpenAI 🌐

The core of our integration involved setting up the **OpenAI** service. We used **TypeScript** to define interfaces for interacting with the **ChatCompletion endpoint**. These interfaces allowed us to structure requests and responses with precise type definitions, ensuring compatibility with the OpenAI API.

### Request Structure:
- **ChatCompletionRequest Interface**: Defined the interface to include parameters such as model, messages, and max_tokens.
  - Ensures requests are correctly formatted.
  - Contains all the necessary information for the OpenAI API.

### Response Handling:
- **ChatCompletionResponse Interface**: Created the interface to handle the responses from OpenAI.
  - Defines expected data, such as choices and message content.
  - Makes it easy to parse and utilize the responses.

## End-to-End Flow 🔄

To provide a seamless user experience, we designed an **end-to-end flow** for handling user input and generating AI-assisted responses.

### Steps:
- **API Endpoint**:
  - Created an endpoint in our Hono app to accept user input and forward it to OpenAI’s ChatCompletion endpoint for processing.
- **Processing User Input**:
  - Structured the user input into a messages array, maintaining conversation context.
- **OpenAI API Call**:
  - Used Bun’s native fetch to make the API call, passing the structured request to OpenAI.
- **Response Formatting**:
  - Parsed and formatted the response to ensure easy consumption before sending it back to the client.

## TypeScript for Safety and Clarity 🛡️

Using **TypeScript** has provided us with strong safety guarantees and improved clarity in our development process. By defining custom types for both requests and responses, we minimized runtime errors and enhanced maintainability.

### Advantages:
- **Type Definitions**: Ensures our code is type-safe and less prone to errors.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Clearly defined types make our codebase easier to understand and maintain.
- **Reduced Runtime Errors**: TypeScript’s static type checking helps catch errors during development, leading to more reliable code.

## ✨ What’s Next?

In the next blog, we’ll dive into how exactly the **scanning process** works and the **tools** we are using for that. Stay tuned for more updates on how we’re bringing our vision to life!
