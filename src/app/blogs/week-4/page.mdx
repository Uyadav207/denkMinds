## 🚀 Empowering Users: Core Functionalities in Place  
We focused on building essential user-centric functionalities this week, ensuring a seamless experience for both new and existing users. Here’s what we accomplished:  
- **User Registration**: Enabling users to securely create accounts and join the platform.

These foundational features are a crucial step toward delivering a **user-friendly and secure product**.
